Usage: $0 [-h] [-d] [-n NUM] [-b BT_TRIM] <boardID>

setmac options:
	-n	number of MAC@ to set.
		(default: number of ethX devices in the system)
	-d	erase the ART sector before setting the MAC@
		(supported for NOR/NAND flash only)
	-b	Set BT MAC address as well as Trim value @ offset BT_OFFSET
	-h	print this help

boardID is used as a seed and expanded through md5sum to create a
supposedly unique MAC@ suffix. Please use something that is unique
for every board.
Example:
$ setmac DB149-010-N0001
