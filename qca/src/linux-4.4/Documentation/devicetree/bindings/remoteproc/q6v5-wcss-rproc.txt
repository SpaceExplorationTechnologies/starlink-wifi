QCA Wakeup Q6-WCSS Remoteproc Driver
=====================================

The IPQ807x family of devices uses a Q6-WCSS DSP co-processor. The Q6-WCSS
requires a firmware binary to boot. The q6-wcss remoteproc driver handles
the loading of firmware and booting of q6-wcss.

Q6v5 WCSS Device Node:
======================
A q6v5-wcss device node is used to represent the Q6-WCSS processor
instance within the SoC. It is needed as child node to SOC parent node
through which it is accessible to the IPQ807x.

Required properties:
--------------------
- compatible:		Should be one of,
				"qcom,q6v5-wcss-rproc" for IPQ807x SoCs
- reg:			Should contain the address ranges for the Q6-WCSS
			internal memory regions, QDSP6SS_PUB. The parent node
			should provide an appropriate range property for
			properly translating these into bus addresses.
- firmware:		Name of firmware file to be used for loading and
			booting the q6-wcss remote processor.
- interrupt-extended	Used to tell the incoming interrupts through SMP2P
- interrupt-names	Names of incoming interrupts
- qcom,smem-states	Output from APPS to Q6 processor
- qcom,smem-state-names Names of the output values from APPS to Q6 processor
- qca,emulation		States that this driver is used on emulation platform
- qca,auto-restart      states that q6 is restarted after receiving error fatal
			from q6
- qca,extended-intc	notifies that virtual interrupt controller is used
			instead of virtual GPIOs
- qca,secure		notifies that TZ is used for bringing q6 out of reset

Example:
--------
/* IPQ807x */
soc {
	q6v5_wcss@0x0AD00000 {
		compatible = "qcom,rproc-q6v5-wcss";
		firmware = "q6-wcss-boot";
		reg = <0xC900000 0x4040>;
		interrupts-extended = <&intc 0 325 1>,
					<&wcss_smp2p_in 0 0>,
					<&wcss_smp2p_in 1 0>,
					<&wcss_smp2p_in 3 0>;
		interrupt-names = "wdog",
				  "fatal",
				  "handover",
				  "stop-ack";
		qcom,smem-states = <&wcss_smp2p_out 0>,
				   <&wcss_smp2p_out 1>;
		qcom,smem-state-names = "shutdown",
					"stop";

		qca,emulation = <1>;
	};
	...
};
