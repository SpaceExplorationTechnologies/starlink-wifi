* Qualcomm Technologies Inc. NSS HLOS Platform Driver.

This driver communicates with the NSS Firmware, and provides empty buffers for
packet-processing to the UBI32 processor.
It also keeps track of sync packets from NSS Firmware.
This driver has 2 sections listed below, one common to all the UBI32 cores and
other specific to each UBI32 core.

1. Driver access details specific to each UBI32/NSS core.

Required properties:
- compatible: "qcom,nss"
- interrupts: UBI32 to Apps interrupts for Sync/Data Packets and Empty Buffers.
- reg-names: Indicates various resources passed to driver by name.
		"nphys","vphys"
		Refers to TCM and CSM Base Addresses of UBI32 Memory map.
- reg: physical address and length of the register set for the device.
- qcom,id: Unique Identifier for the HLOS block.This field is unique identifier
	   for the core, which is also used as an index for global nss context.
- clocks: physical address for NSS source clock, TCM clock and fabric clock.
- resets: physical address for core clock reset, AHB and AXI reset.
- qcom,load-addr: physical address to load NSS firmware.
- qcom,num-queue: how many UBI32 to Apps queue enabled.
- qcom,turbo-frequency = turbo freq supported or not.
- qcom,low-frequency = lowest supported operating frequency.
- qcom,mid-frequency = nominal supported operating frequency.
- qcom,max-frequency = maximum supported operating frequency.

Optional properties:

Each of the following properity indicates that a specific feature is enabled on
this UBI32 core that allows data/stats commnicatin with the Apps CPU
