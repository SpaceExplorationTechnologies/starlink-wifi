QSEECOM DRIVER
--------------

This driver acts as an interface for communication between the secure and non-
secure world which allows us to load and run applications securely.

Required properties:
  - compatible = "ipq807x-qseecom"; for IPQ807x device
		= "ipq8064-qseecom"; for IPQ8064 device
		= "ipq40xx-qseecom"; for IPQ40xx device
  - mem-start: Address in reserved memory region to load the application
  - mem-size: Size available for the application

Note:
mem-start and mem-size entries should not be given for ipq8064 device as it is
taken from the elf data.

Example:

qseecom {
	compatible = "ipq807x-qseecom";
	mem-start = <0x4a400000>;
	mem-size = <0x200000>;
};
